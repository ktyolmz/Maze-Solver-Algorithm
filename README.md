# Maze-Solver-Algorithm

In this project, I created the recursively Maze Solver Algorithm to find the paths goes to the treasures in given map. These maps contain 3 groups of characters: 

1. Walls -> Represented with “+”, “-“, and “|” characters.

2. Available paths -> Represented with lower case characters such as “a”, “b”, “c” and etc. 

3. Treasures -> Represented with capital “E” characters.

Program expect to .txt file name from console. This file should consist of the map.

Maze's entrance always at the second row and first column.

Algorithm uses the stack to track the path. Even it stuck, It goes back and tries to find new avaible paths.
